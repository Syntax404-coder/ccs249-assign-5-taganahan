# Word/Vector Semantics

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to associate meaning with specific words in a corpus using two primary approaches:
1. **Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: A statistical method to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).
2. **Word Vectors**: A technique to represent words as vectors in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.

## Features
- Implementation of TF-IDF for word importance analysis.
- Use of word embeddings to capture semantic similarity.
- Example datasets for testing and experimentation.
- Modular and extensible codebase for further development.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-vector-semantics.git
